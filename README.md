# Prediction Model With Linear Regression
ðŸ“ˆ Prediction Model with Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the development of a simple yet powerful linear regression model to predict outcomes based on input features. It serves as an introduction to supervised learning, model evaluation, and data visualization.

ðŸ§  Project Overview
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, we:

Explore and clean a real-world dataset

Visualize relationships between variables

Train a linear regression model

Evaluate model performance using key metrics

Make predictions and visualize results
